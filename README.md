# ETEC-AC

  This is a repository that I am developing on the ETEC Alcides Cestari website as a way of saying thanks for the learning that is being passed on to me through the internship. Having as main advisor and Professor MÃ¡rcio Vazzi.

Plans and goals:
  The task that was given to me was a website where I needed to contain all the school information, among them as an example:
History, Courses, Teachers and Staff, News, Political and Documentary Information and a few other things

# Notes:
The site is still under development, but I have a deadline to deliver it until June 2022. I'm still organizing it in stages, so I'm creating folders and backups to work without losing progress.
